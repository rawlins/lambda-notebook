    "###Upgrading from IPython 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda notebook now requires IPython 3 / Jupyter notebook.  This is a somewhat substantial upgrade to the infrastructure, though it doesn't majorly affect lambda notebook operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one main change: lambda notebooks need to run under a specialized \"kernel\" that preloads the lambda notebook packages and infrastructure.  If this kernel is running, you will see \"Lambda Notebook\" in the upper right corner of your browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Running the lambda notebook will install the kernel.  (Note: This will allow lambda notebooks to work in IPython notebook in general.)\n",
    "  * When creating a new notebook, choose \"Lambda Notebook (Python 3)\" as the kernel, not just \"Python 3\".\n",
    "  * To upgrade a notebook, open the notebook (you should get a message about updating the format), and then under the Kernel menu, choose \"Change kernel\" -> \"Lambda Notebook (Python 3)\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "The IPython notebook is being renamed to \"Jupyter Notebook\", hence the change in graphics."
