    "# Lambda notebook metalanguage overview\n",
    "### Author: Kyle Rawlins\n",
    "\n",
    "__Last updated__: Feb 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the lambda notebook is a flexible and extensible typed logical metalanguage implemented in python -- the __Lambda Notebook Metalanguage (LNM)__.  The metalanguage is python-like, and can be interacted with either by cell magics, or by a python API.  Expressions of the metalanguage are parsed into python representations that can be interacted with programmatically.  There are three main aspects of the metalanguage to document: (i) the type system, (ii) the class hierarchy that supports this implementation, and (iii) the parser for writing metalanguage expressions directly. This notebook goes over each of these at an overview level; many aspects of the metalanguage have detailed documentation in separate notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the technical level, the core unit of the implementation of LNM is the `TypedExpr` class.  Every expression is implemented as an instance of one of its subclasses.  A `TypedExpr` has a type together with an identity and set of behaviors for that type, and consists structurally of 0 or more argument slots. The arguments slots describe subexpressions, and themselves will always be subclasses `TypedExpr`. A `TypedExpr` that has 0 subexpressions is either a term or an empty data structure (e.g. an empty set). The behaviors provided by a class can include simplification and reduction patterns, type inference, variable binding in subexpressions, LaTeX rendering, and more."

    "The type system will be familiar to anyone who has used a typed lambda calculus or logical system such as Ty2, and this documentation assumes some basic familiarity with typed lambda calculi.  The standard definition of this sort of type hierarchy looks something like this, where rule 2 defines functional types:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. $e$ and $t$ are types.  (_atomic types_)\n",
    " 2. If $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are types, so is $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta\\rangle$. (_non-atomic types_)\n",
    " 3. Nothing else is a type.\n",

    "The rule in 2 is sometimes characterized as giving a *type constructor*: the function type constructor given two types, produces a functional type notated as above. The type system here is extensible and designed for practical use, so we won't work with a strict definition, but the basic ideas hold.  A type system in the lambda notebook consists of a set of atomic types and non-atomic type constructors that are recursively constructed.  The library provides three atomic types by default:\n",

    " * $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta\\rangle$: functional types, where the left is the input type and the right the output type.\n",
    " * $(\\alpha_0,...\\alpha_n)$: tuple types, for building tuples from atomic (or non-atomic) types.  In practice, what are often treated in logic as n-ary constants are treated here as functions from n-ary tuples to truth-values.\n",
    " * $\\{\\alpha\\}$: set types, for sets of elements of type $\\alpha$.\n",
    " * $[\\alpha_0,...\\alpha_n]$: a disjunctive type, which can match any of the listed elements.\n",

    "The library also provides a mechanism for type polymorphism with type variables, what are written as $X$, $Y$, with any number of primes following or a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "All types are interpreted and parsed relative to a type system, and in `meta` a current type system is defined; this can be accessed with `meta.get_type_system()`.  A convenience function `meta.tp` (imported into the notebook's namespace) calls the type system's parser; this has a corresponding line magic, `%tp`.

    "### Basic operator expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators (and numeric operators) are supported using python syntax for bitwise operations.  This should be mostly straightforward for anyone familiar with classical logic.  As you might expect, types are enforced.  The parsed syntax is (with a few exceptions) the same as the python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __numeric operators__: The operators `+` (unary and binary), `-` (unary and binary), `*`, `/`, and `**` all work as expected for type `n`, as well as `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.\n",
    " * __equality__: The metalanguage provides a semantic equivalence operator that can be written as `<=>`, `==`, or `%` in metalanguage code. At type `t`, this will specialize to a standard biconditional operator, but a generic version is present at any type. Of course, simplifying expressions of equivalence is highly non-trivial in the general case (though many special cases can be handled). Note that the `==` operator cannot be used on python objects, where it is implemented in a non-metalanguage use; the `%` operator can be used, as well as the member function `equivalent_to`. In metalanguage expressions, the non-equivalence operator can be used for boolean objects only, instantiated by `!=`, `=/=`, and `^`. Only the latter is available in python code.\n",
    " * __logical operators__: similarly, python's logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) do not work on metalanguage objects, and also cannot be used in metalanguage expressions. Rather, the operators `&` (and), `|` (or) and `~` (not) should be used. (These are python bitwise operators, and this setup is due to constraints in the python data model. This use of bitwise operators may also be familiar from packages like `pandas`, `sympy`, etc.) The material implication operator uses `>>`.  In the metalanguage (but not python), `==>` will also work.\n",
    "    - A ternary conditional operator, named `Case`, can be used with a predicate-argument syntax. This operator takes a boolean condition, with an if and an else argument that must have matching types. Rather than a typical programming language `if...else...` construct, it is better thought of in terms of standard mathematical definition by cases, and is rendered like this in LaTeX.\n",
    " * __set operators__: See the set documentation for more on set operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Operator precedence__: the operators currently all use [python precedence](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence), even in LNM. This will mostly work as you would expect, but there are occasional caveats. For example, because equality uses `%`, it takes corresponding precedence over most other operators. It is always safe to use parentheses to disambiguate."
