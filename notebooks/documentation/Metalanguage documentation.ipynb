    "# Lambda notebook metalanguage documentation\n",
    "### Author: Kyle Rawlins\n",
    "\n",
    "__Last updated__: Feb 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the lambda notebook is a flexible and extensible typed logical metalanguage implemented in python -- the __Lambda Notebook Metalanguage (LNM)__.  The metalanguage is python-like, and can be interacted with either by cell magics, or by a python API.  Expressions of the metalanguage are parsed into python representations that can be interacted with programmatically.  There are three main aspects of the metalanguage to document: (i) the type system, (ii) the class hierarchy that supports this implementation, and (iii) the parser for writing metalanguage expressions directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the technical level, the core unit of the implementation of LNM is the TypedExpr class.  Every expression is an instance of this class or one of its subclasses.  A TypedExpr has a type, and consists of an 'operator' slot, and 0 or more argument slots.  The operator slot is, in most cases, filled by a logical operator or a function.  In a few special cases (terms), it is used to store a variable or constant name.  All `TypedExpr` objects implement routines to be printed in an ipython notebook.  Also, `repr` returns a string that is guaranteed to be a parseable LNM expression that will lead to the same object."

    "The type system will be familiar to anyone who has used a typed lambda calculus or logical system such as Ty2, and this documentation assumes some basic familiarity with typed lambda calculi.  The standard definition of this sort of type hierarchy looks something like this, where rule 2 defines functional types:\n",

    " 1. $e$ and $t$ are types.  (_atomic types_)\n",

    " 3. Nothing else is a type.\n",

    "The type system here is extensible and designed for practical use, so it isn't useful to consider such a strict definition, but the basic ideas hold.  A type system in the lambda notebook consists of a set of atomic types and non-atomic types.  The library provides three atomic types: \n",

    " * $t$ (truth-values)\n",
    " * $e$ (entities)\n",

    " * $(\\alpha_0,...\\alpha_n)$: tuple types, for building tuples from atomic (or non-atomic) types.  In practice, what are often treated in logic as n-ary constants are treated here as functions from n-ary tuples to truth-values.\n",

A convenience function `meta.tp` (imported into the notebook's namespace) calls the type system's parser.  By default, the type system is `types.under_system`."

    "\n",
    "Logical operators (and numeric operators) are supported using python syntax for bitwise operations.  This should be mostly straightforward for anyone familiar with classical logic.  As you might expect, types are enforced.  The parsed syntax is (with a few exceptions) the same as the python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representations are always bracketed unambiguously, and python operator precedence defines bracketing.  This is mostly straightforward with a few caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __equality__: the operators `==` and `!=` will not behave as expected in the metalanguage.  Instead use '`<=>`' and '`=/=`' in LNM expressions.\n",
    " * __logical operators__: similarly, python's logical operators (`&&` etc) do not work on LNM.  Use the python bitwise operator symbols instead.\n",
    " * __precedence__: the operators currently all use python precedence, even in LNM, which can lead to counterintuitive results.  Parenthesis should be used to disambiguate, rather than relying on precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material implication operator uses `>>`.  In the metalanguage (but not python), `==>` will also work."

Existential and universal quantification are expressions of type $t$, that bind a variable of some type and whose body is type $t$.  Sets can also be defined using a similar notation, but their overall type is the type of a set whose elements are the variable's type.\n",
