    "# Presuppositions via partiality\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heim & Kratzer approach to presuppositions works by allowing denotations and functions to be partially defined: the definedness conditions characterize the conditions under which the presupposition is satisfied.  Strictly speaking, it is *only* denotations and functions that involve partiality in this system, that is, not ordinary formulas (to the extent they exist in H&K).  However, it is impossible to implement this without having some representation for partiality in the metalanguage.  This is accomplished with the class `meta.Partial`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most subclasses of `TypedExpr`, instances of `Partial` do not have their own unique type -- their type is determined from their content.  Orthogonally to the type system, they layer a typed expression of type `t` on top of that content object, corresponding to the partiality.  They are drawn with two rows between bars.  The following example is the expression of type `e` that refers to `John`, but has a definedness condition that that individual be salient.  In the strict Heim and Kratzer sense, such formulas don't really appear on their own, since definedness conditions like this need to be associated with some denotation, as in the second cell below."

These are cases that as humans working with Heim & Kratzer pseudo-formulas in our head we can usually just get automatically, but they are not at all straightforward to think through mechanically.  Here is an example using the presupposition entry for `dog` above.  The partiality condition resulting from application gets lodged in a subformula under the existential quantifier, which actually binds into the partiality condition.  While this isn't necessarily the true analysis of `dog`, this situation might easily arise e.g. with relative clauses containing presupposition triggers."

    "Simplifying this requires some semantics for the metalanguage (i.e. a formal understanding of what partiality should amount to in expressions like this).  The projection problem to some degree rests on this as well.  What the lambda notebook implements for this composition system is a fairly strict notion of partiality (that sometimes does odd things).  It is important to be clear that this is **not** a three-valued logic, and will behave quite differently from the usual three-valued logics used for projection in a range of cases.\n",

    "The result of projecting the partiality out of the subformula above can be seen by composing the two NL items together.  As a rule, this sort of inference is not automatically triggered in the metalanguage ever, but is always triggered by composition (following the Heim and Kratzer treatment of partiality, I would argue).  This could be forced in the metalanguage by calling `calculate_partiality()` on a `TypedExpr`."
