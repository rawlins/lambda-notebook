    "\n",
    "The Heim & Kratzer approach to presuppositions works by allowing denotations and functions to be partially defined: the definedness conditions characterize the conditions under which the presupposition is satisfied.  Strictly speaking, it is *only* denotations and functions that involve partiality in this system, that is, not ordinary formulas (to the extent they exist in H&K).  However, it is impossible to implement this without having some representation for partiality in the metalanguage.  This is accomplished with the class `meta.Partial`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most subclasses of `TypedExpr`, instances of `Partial` do not have their own unique type -- their type is determined from their content.  Orthogonally to the type system, they layer a typed expression of type `t` on top of that content object, corresponding to the partiality.  They are drawn with two rows between bars.  The following example is the expression of type `e` that refers to `John`, but has a definedness condition that that individual be salient.  In the strict Heim and Kratzer sense, such formulas don't really appear on their own, since definedness conditions like this need to be associated with some denotation, as in the second cell below."

In *weak* mode, the projected partiality condition to the domain is the minimum to support the truth or falsity of a the quantified body, with the same value for the variable in both the body and the condition. In several cases, the body will also need to incorporate the condition.  In *strict* mode, the entire domain must satisfy the condition for the quantification to get off the ground. Strict mode is easier to understand, and probably more natural from the model-theoretic perspective, but unfortunately it isn't very useful in practical terms because the projected partiality conditions are very strong.\n",
