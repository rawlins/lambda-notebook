    "The Heim & Kratzer approach to presuppositions works by allowing denotations and functions to be partially defined: the definedness conditions characterize the conditions under which the presupposition is satisfied.  Strictly speaking, it is *only* denotations and functions that involve partiality in this system, that is, not ordinary formulas (to the extent they exist in H&K).  However, it is impossible to implement this without having some representation for partiality in the metalanguage.  This is accomplished with the class `meta.Partial`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most subclasses of `TypedExpr`, instances of `Partial` do not have their own unique type -- their type is determined from their content.  Orthogonally to the type system, they layer a typed expression of type `t` on top of that content object, corresponding to the partiality.  They are drawn with two rows between bars.  The following example is the expression of type `e` that refers to `Joanna`, but has a definedness condition that that individual be salient.  In the strict Heim and Kratzer sense, such formulas don't really appear on their own, since definedness conditions like this need to be associated with some denotation, as in the second cell below."

For example, assuming the presuppositional entry above for \"bachelor\", consider the sentence, *Everyone is a bachelor*. This involves the formula $Adult(x)$ in the scope of a $\\forall x$. To ensure that this formula is interpretable, the semantics of `Partial` will require that every element in the domain meet this presupposition.
