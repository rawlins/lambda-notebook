    "* `|`: $\\vee$ (disjunction at type `t`)\n",
    "* `>>`, `==>`: $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "* `==`, `<=>`, `%`: equality at various types.  For `t`, this will produce $\\leftrightarrow$.\n",
    "* `=/=`, `^`: non-equality at various types.\n",
    "* `<<`: set membership / $\\in$\n",
    "* numeric operators are just the python ones (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`, `**`)\n",

    "  - variables: lowercase followed by underscore and type, e.g. `x_e`\n",
    "  - constants: uppercase, e.g. `P_<e,t>`\n",
    "* To add partiality conditions use the call `Partial` in either the metalanguage or in python, e.g. `L x_e : Partial(Body(x), Condition(x))`.  Effective use of partiality conditions requires the correct composition system and some care; see [Partiality documentation.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/documentation/Partiality%20documentation.ipynb) for more details.\n",

    "* `m.simplify_all()` simplifies certain things.  (Not everything that could be simplified is implemented.)\n",
    "* `m(m2)` attempts to build a function-argument expression from `m` as function and `m2` as argument.  Type checking/inference is enforced, but no reduction happens.\n",
    "  - `m(m2).reduce_all()` does reduction as well.  This is what you have probably been trained to expect from programming languages.\n",
    "* `m == m2` checks syntactic equality.\n",
    "* For most other python operators, `m op m2` produces a complex TypedExpr based on the behavior in the metalanguage parser.  Certain special cases that aren't python operators don't work in python.  In some special cases other things are overriden in python (e.g. `*` for functions does function composition).\n",
    "* `m.copy()` should work as expected for any metalanguage object.  It usually returns a shallow copy.\n",
    "* `m.under_assignment(a)` uses `a` as a dict mapping variable names to metalanguage values operating on any free terms in `a`.\n",
    "* `m.free_variables()` returns a python set containing any variables free in `m`.\n",
    "* `m.term()` returns true iff `m` is a term.  (Safer than checking using `isinstance`).\n",
    "* advanced: `m.type_env()` shows the complete type inference environment in `m`.\n",
    "* advanced: `m[0]` gives the operator, which may be a string, and `m[1]` etc give arguments.  Generally there are 0, 1 or 2 arguments (terms, unary combinations, binary operators).  Exceptions: tuples, listed sets."
