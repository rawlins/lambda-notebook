    "\n",
    "Classes in `lamb.meta` deal with metalanguage elements.  The metalanguage is the primary thing you write in `%%lamb` cells, as well as with `%te`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metalanguage operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* `~`: $\\neg$ (negation at type `t`)\n",
    "* `&`: $\\wedge$ (conjunction at type `t`), $\\cap$ (set intersection)\n",
    "* `|`: $\\vee$ (disjunction at type `t`), $\\cup$ (set union)\n",
    "* `>>`, `==>`: $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "* `==`, `<=>`, `%`: equality at various types.  For `t`, this will produce $\\leftrightarrow$.\n",
    "* `=/=`, `^`: non-equality at various types.\n",
    "* Set relations: `<<`: set membership / $\\in$, `<` (proper subset / $\\subset$), `<=` (subset / $\\subseteq$), `>`/`>=`. For set types `-` gives set difference.\n",
    "* numeric operators are just the python ones (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`, `**`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metalanguage binding expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Unrestricted syntax: `Op var: body`. Restricted syntax: `Op var << restrictor: body` (where `restrictor` is a set expression (any metalanguage expression with a set type) that is consistent with the variable's type).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Lambda x_X: ...`: build a lambda term; body of any type. Overall type is `<X,Y>` where `Y` is the body type.\n",
    "  - Also works: `L x:`, `Î» x:`\n",
    "* `Exists x_X: ...`: existential / $\\exists$; body of type `t`, overall type `t`. Supports restriction.\n",
    "* `Forall x_X: ...`: universal / $\\forall$; body of type `t`, overall type `t`. Supports restriction.\n",
    "* `ExistsExact x_X: ...`: existential with upper bounding / $\\exists !$; body of type `t`, overall type `t`. Supports restriction.\n",
    "* `Iota x_X: ...` / `IotaPartial x_X: ...`: reference to a unique element / $\\iota$; body of type `t`, overall type `X`. Each has a slightly different approaches to the uniqueness constraint.  Supports restriction.\n",
    "* `Set x_X: ...`: build a set based on some conditions; body of type `t`, overall type is `{X}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other metalanguage elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* tuples: write `(a1,...an)`\n",
    "* sets by list: write `{a1,...an}`\n",
    "* terms:\n",
    "  - variables: lowercase followed by underscore and type, e.g. `x_e`\n",
    "  - constants: uppercase, e.g. `P_<e,t>`\n",
    "* To add partiality conditions use the call `Partial` in either the metalanguage or in python, e.g. `L x_e : Partial(Body(x), Condition(x))`.  Effective use of partiality conditions requires the correct composition system and some care; see [Partiality documentation.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/documentation/Partiality%20documentation.ipynb) for more details.\n",
    "* metaterms are non-assignable constants that correspond to underlying domain elements.\n",
    "  - Built-in metaterms `True_t` and `False_t` make up the domain for type `t`.\n",
    "  - Numbers in the metalanguage instantiate metaterms corresponding to underlying python numbers.\n",
    "  - The domain for `e` by default consists of metaterm elements named with `c` followed by a non-optional non-negative integer. To instantiate these in the metalanguage parser, use a prefixing underscore, e.g. `_c0`. In general, the `_` prefix indicates that something is a metaterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### magics\n",
    "\n",
    "* the `%te` line magic is basically the same as calling the `te` function on a string, and parses a meta-language expression\n",

    "* advanced: some aspects of type inference are hidden from the user of this function; if you'd like to see them, you can call this with the parameter `let=False`.\n",
    "* advanced: `te` can also take an optional assignment.\n",

    "* `m.reduce_all()` reduces any lambda expressions.\n",
    "* `m.simplify_all()` simplifies certain things.  (Not everything that could be simplified is implemented.)\n",
    "* `m(m2)` attempts to build a function-argument expression from `m` as function and `m2` as argument.  Type checking/inference is enforced, but no reduction happens.\n",
    "  - `m(m2).reduce_all()` does reduction as well.  This is what you have probably been trained to expect from programming languages.\n",
    "* `m == m2` checks syntactic equality.\n",
    "* For most other python operators, `m op m2` produces a complex TypedExpr based on the behavior in the metalanguage parser.  Certain special cases that aren't python operators don't work in python.  In some special cases other things are overriden in python (e.g. `*` for functions does function composition).\n",
    "* `m.copy()` should work as expected for any metalanguage object.  It returns a shallow copy.\n",
    "* `m.under_assignment(a)` uses `a` as a dict mapping variable names to metalanguage values operating on any free terms in `a`.\n",
    "* `m.free_variables()` returns a python set containing any variables free in `m`.\n",
    "* `m.term()` returns true iff `m` is a term.  (Safer than checking using `isinstance`).\n",
    "* advanced: `m.type_env()` shows the complete type inference environment in `m`.\n",
    "* advanced: indexing into a metalanguage expression gives the component expressions. For example, `m[0]` on a `&` expression gives the left conjunct. Generally, there are 0 (for terms), 1, or 2 subelements, the details of which are class specific. `len` can be used to find the length. Tuples and listed sets are arbitrary length."
