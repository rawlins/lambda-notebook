    "# Domain elements and `MetaTerm`s\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda notebook metalanguage supports a notion of \"ontological reference\" via expressions of class **`lamb.meta.meta.MetaTerm`**. Essentially, any type in the type system can correspond to some set of **domain elements**, and these domain elements are potential objects of reference for expressions of that type. A `MetaTerm` instantiates a reference to a domain element directly into the metalanguage. Domain elements are in general modeled via arbitrary python objects that are \"outside\" of the metalanguage itself. In certain cases, there are natural candidates in python that have similar semantics (relative to the metalanguage, metametasemantics) to what we are looking for as the object of reference. As a simple example, the following cell produces an expression consisting only of a `MetaTerm` at type `t`:"

    "**Identifying `MetaTerm`s** (preliminaries): in rich reprs `MetaTerm`s are rendered with a sans serif font, and in plain reprs, a prefixing `_` symbol indicates meta status (`True`/`False` and numbers excluded). In code, an expression's meta status can be programmatically checked via the `TypedExpr` member function `meta()`; this is better than doing an explicit `isinstance` check.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`MetaTerms` vs. terms in general**:\n",
    "In general, `MetaTerm`s can be thought of as a special kind of term that wraps the domain element and allows it to appear in the metalanguage; they compare equal (and hash equal) to their domain element counterpart. They are implemented as terms (and satisfy `TypedExpr.term()`) but are never counted as free terms, cannot be changed by assignments, cannot be bound, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they are both terms, `TypedTerm` constants are not `MetaTerm`s! This may be a somewhat weird conceptual distinction depending on how you were taught logic. The intuition is that a `MetaTerm` is reference to the *actual thing*, whereas a regular constant is more like a name for some thing. (Of course, in computational modeling we never really have the actual thing; in this case just a python object that is yet another proxy.) In the metalanguage, regular constants are not automatically valued to domain elements without being filled in by an assignment (or execution context). In the lambda notebook metalanguage, a regular constant is just a free term that cannot be bound within a metalanguage expression, and a variable is a term that may be bound (or may not be); `MetaTerm`s are not free. Another way to put it: a regular constant is something whose value will be a single domain element, but without an assignment we don't know what that value is, and it could be anything in the domain. A `MetaTerm` can only have the value of the thing to which it refers, and this is entirely assignment-independent."
