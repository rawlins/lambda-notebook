    "# Composition systems (`lamb.lang.composition`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is the primary documentation for composition systems, as well as ways of displaying semantic composition, for the lambda notebook. Composition systems are primarily housed in the `lamb.lang.composition` module, though some commonly used functions and classes are exported to `lamb.lang` for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A `CompositionSystem` is, abstractly, a collection of ways of doing composition on some kind of object language elements via a mapping of those to metalanguage elements. This mapping is, again abstractly, managed by objects that implement the `Composable` interface. So, given some sequence of compatible `Composable`s, a `CompositionSystem` will search for ways of putting them together to produce a new `Composable` that aggregates any possible compositions of elements in the sequence. For most purposes, you will work with the active composition system set at the package-level, accessed via `lamb.lang.get_system` and `lamb.lang.set_system`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: the `Item` class and `CompositionResult`s with purely bottom-up composition\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a range of ways that `Composable`s can work internally, and they may cover one or more object language elements, with zero or more metalanguage elements for each of those. However, it is most useful for introductory purposes to start with a core class used across all composition systems: `lamb.lang.Item`. Objects of this class map a single string to a single metalanguage element. Items are exactly the class instantiated using the `%%lamb` magic with `||...|||`:"

In the default system, composition is purely bottom-up, that is, all you need to do to get a composition result is to have the pieces and some valid composition operation. The `*` operator will use the currently active module-level composition system to try to do this, giving another `Composable` as a result. In general, what sort of object you get back depends on the composition system, but for the default one, the result will be a `CompositionResult` object. This object represents a stage of composition, and can hold multiple composition paths. Each path is itself represented as a `Composable`. To access these, you can index the result object directly, and like `Item`, the objects used internally implement `name` and `content`. For this composition system, the name of composition results is determined by the operation and the parts, so therefore the name may vary depending on how composition proceeded and `CompositionResult` itself does not implement `name`. Its `content` field will contain a list.

The value of `content` will be a metalanguage expression (or `None` in special cases). The value of `name` is programmatically constructed from the names of the parts and cannot be set.

This kind of composition system, implemented as a `lamb.lang.composition.TreeCompositionSystem`, is more complicated, and somewhat richer than pure bottom-up composition. The `lamb.lang` package provides a composition system, `hk_system`, modeled roughly after the composition system described in Heim & Kratzer 1998, chapter 3. Similar to the default `td_system`, it implements FA, PM, and PA. Like Heim and Kratzer, it explicitly handles non-branching nodes and lexicon lookup as composition rules.

    "* **NN**: A non-branching node rule. This simply percolates meaning up a unary branching tree fragment. Combinator: `L x_X : x`.\n",
    "* **VAC**: Same as above, but operating on binary tree fragments.\n",
    "* **IDX**: A rule to percolate indices in unary structures. If a tree fragment has a child with an index, it will inherit that index. For example, a fragment like `[XP Binder(i)]` will be also indexed with `i`. This applies recursively. (This is used, e.g., in the Heim and Kratzer account of restrictive relative clauses, where a wh-item is treated as the binder.)\n",
