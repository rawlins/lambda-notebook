    "Mechanically, you can write type variables using `X`, `Y`, and `Z` followed by any number or number of primes.  So for example, `<X,Y15>` is a function from some type `X` to some type `Y15`.  You also may occasionally see some variable types with the letter `I`; these are internal types and you cannot directly use such types.  See below for ways of dealing with them.\n",

For example, the type checking for a typical combination of `<e,t>` with `e` boils down to the following call to the type unification procedure (recall that `tp` invokes the type parser), which finds a variable assignment of `X` to `t` that can unify the two types:"

    "Here, the `I`-prefixed type variable is a new (sometimes termed _fresh_) type variable (the exact number may vary substantially).  For human readability, the output of the `%te` magic reduces the type variables it uses (via a version of alpha conversion) to have low numbers, and not be internal types.  Why is this legitimate?  The result of `%te` as well as assignment in the `%lamb` magic have their type variables in the scope of a `let` operator.  A `let` operator binds type variables and treats them as _generic_.  A variable inside a `let` operator does not have to obey constraints imposed on a variable of the same name not in the scope of that `let`.  Let-scoped expressions may therefore safely have their variables renamed as long as internal type constraints are obeyed.\n",

It is possible to disable let in direct calls to `te`, but currently I don't see that this should be much needed.  Here is the above function-argument example without a let operator, and then with expicit variable renaming performed.  Note that here the input `X` bears no relation to the output `X`."
