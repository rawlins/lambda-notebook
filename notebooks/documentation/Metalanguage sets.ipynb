    "The lambda notebook metalanguage supports sets and set operations in various ways, largely implemented in the `lamb.meta.sets` module. The set theory here is standard naive set theory, but in the concept of a typed metalanguage. A set in this system should be thought of as containing values of metalanguage expressions, i.e. type-theoretic objects. As an initial example, here is a little set at type `{e}`:"

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of building a basic set in the metalanguage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`lamb.meta.sets.ListedSet`** allows constructing finite sets by listing elements, where elements can be arbitrary typed expressions. Invoke in the metalanguage using pythonic `{x,y,...}` notation as above.\n",
    "* **`lamb.meta.sets.ConditionSet`** allows describing a set by giving a boolean condition on a variable. Invoke using metalanguage binding operator notation, `Set x: ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to construct `MetaTerm` sets of concrete elements, though not directly via the metalanguage parser. These are equivalent to `ListedSet`s of concrete elements, and will be produced internally in certain cases (for example, when simplifying expressions that involve quantifying over finite set domains). This document won't deal directly with them, but they should be interchangeable with `ListedSet`s of equivalent meta-elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of these, various standard operations and relations are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set membership, written with the operator `<<`.\n",
    "* Operations: union, intersection, and difference; written with operators `|`, `&`, and `-` respectively.\n",
    "* Relations: equality, and (proper) sub/supersethood; written with operators `<=>`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set types** are written with a circumfix type constructor `{X}` for inner type `X`. So for example, `{<e,t>}` is the type of sets of functions from `e` to `t`. While type variables are allowed, genuinely polymorphic sets are not supported, i.e. `X` must resolve to a consistent simple type. One caveat on this: when an empty set is constructed without further guidance, its type is treated as unknown (see below in the `ListedSet` documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "`ListedSet`s and `ConditionSet`s are not distinguished at all in the type system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General simplification and execution notes**: simplifying set expressions is fairly non-trivial, and the metalanguage simplification code is generally only complete when dealing with \"concrete\" sets that consist of `MetaTerm`s; this is discussed in detail below. There are two simplify options that are directly relevance; these will try to eliminate set operations, relations, and descriptions to the extent possible. The option `eliminate_sets_all` tries to eliminate everything, and `eliminate_sets` (entailed by the former) tries to eliminate everything but membership statements with listed sets of cardinality >1. This may appear quite ad-hoc at first glance, and it is certainly heuristic, but this is because the general case of $\\in$ expressions convert to long, unreadable, and slow-to-execute disjunctions of equalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set code supports compilation/execution fully when dealing with finite domains. Currently, expressions that require quantification do not support compilation for non-finite domains at all (even for cases where this might be in principle possible)."

This is because we can't determine identity without resolving those free terms. As an example, consider whether the two sets `{_c1, x_e}` and `{_c1}` are equivalent. From a quick glance applying standard naive set theory, the answer may appear to be no. However, the answer is a solid *maybe*. In particular, if `x_e` resolves to `_c1`, then the left set is `{_c1, _c1}`, which is equivalent to `{_c1}`. However, if `x` resolves to something else, then they aren't equivalent.

    "### Conversions and tests on sets and containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factory functions were mentioned earlier when discussion `ListedSet` construction. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `meta.sets.sset`: factory function for construction a pre-simplified `ListedSet`\n",
    "* `meta.sets.emptyset`: factory function for empty sets specifically\n",
    "* `meta.core.from_python_container`: given a python set/sequence container of `TypedExpr`s (including any container implementing `collections.abc.Set`), produce a corresponding `TypedExpr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful tests for sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `meta.sets.finite_safe`: returns true for certain finite set cases, namely those constructed from `ListedSet`s or `MetaTerm`s by set operations. These are cases where we are guaranteed finiteness.\n",
    "* `meta.sets.is_emptyset`: for any of the ways of constructing a set, (syntactically) check if it's an empty set. For `ListedSet`s and `MetaTerm` sets, this is straightforward. For `ConditionSet`s, the semantic version of this is of course highly non-trivial, but this function returns true on condition sets with a simple `False` condition.\n",
    "* `meta.core.is_concrete`: returns true on any `TypedExpr` data structure constructed (finitely) from `MetaTerm`s, including sets. These are essentially the cases where membership testing semantics is exactly that of naive set theory. (This doesn't accept sets constructed from operations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, for conversion *out* of `TypedExpr` space:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ListedSet` and `MetaTerm` implement a member function `set()` that gives back a python `frozenset` of `TypedExpr`s. For a `MetaTerm`, this obviously would require a set type (and will raise if the term doesn't have one). If you want recursion, you probbly want one of the following two more general functions.\n",
    "* `meta.core.to_python_container`: recursively converts `ListedSet` (and `Tuple`) structures, as well as their corresponding `MetaTerm` cases, into matching python `frozenset` (and `tuple`) objects.\n",
    "* `meta.core.to_concrete`: similar to the previous, but accepts any `TypedExpr` and in a top-down way, converts as much as possible to python containers. This produces a useful normal form of sorts for working with the set/tuple container classes."
