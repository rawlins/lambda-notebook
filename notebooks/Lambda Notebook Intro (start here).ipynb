    "# The IPython Lambda Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the [IPython Lambda Notebook](http://lambdanotebook.com/)!  This is a tool based on the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), tailored for doing calculations of the sort involved in linguistic semantics.  The focus is mainly on those calculations involving the typed lambda calculus that are typically involved in theories of *compositionality*.  The documentation mostly assumes some basic knowledge of compositionality (though you can see [this tutorial](/notebooks/An%20introduction%20to%20compositionality%20via%20%22two%20plus%20two%20is%20four%22.ipynb) if you would like a review.)  The overall aim of the lambda notebook is to provide facilities for writing '*digital fragments*' -- working implementations of a compositional system developed in the course of linguistics research.  The Lambda Notebook is very much in an early state, what might be called a public alpha, but because it is based on Jupyter, it inherits many extremely powerful tools aimed at scientific computing. \n",

Code cells without a \"magic\" command on the first line, which would be indicated by `%%`, contain ordinary python code.  The value of the last line of any python cell, as long as it is not `None`, is displayed when the cell is executed.  Hit *shift+enter* on the following cell to see a basic example."

    "Please see the notebook [Lambda Notebook Demo.ipynb](http:///notebooks/Lambda%20Notebook%20Demo.ipynb) for many more examples of how to use these two modes.

A good starting point for understanding and extending the lambda notebook is [tutorials/Type shifting.ipynb](http:///notebooks/tutorials/Type%20shifting.ipynb), which goes through the process of adding a variety of type-shifting operations to a compositinoal system.  Many further examples of various things you might want to do are provided as well, and we welcome contributions.\n",

For example: '$\\lambda x : x \\in D_e \\:.\\: x\\text{ is a cat}$'.

    "## 2. Interface and background on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambda Notebook is based heavily on the Jupyter Notebook and most of the interface you are seeing is Jupyter.  Because the Jupyter Notebook is purely browser-based, its interface may be somewhat idiosyncratic compared to native apps that you are used to.  We are working on a closer native wrapping at least for OS X, but in the meantime here are some things that may be helpful in understanding what is going on for users who are new to Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    " * IPython/Jupyter is an enhanced interface to python that supports many extremely useful things; one of the main targets is interfacing with the 'scipy stack', for doing scientific and mathematical computing of the sort often done in R and matlab.  It also provides good support for distributed computing.\n",
    " * Jupyter Notebook is a particular interface to IPython (and other languages) inspired by mathematica notebooks, and is centered around interleaving code with documentation.\n",
    " * The Jupyter Notebook runs as a server, accessible only from your local computer (at least by default).  You then select and edit notebooks via a web browser that contacts this server.  Typically it runs at the URL [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888), and you can access this from any browser as long as the server is running.\n",
    " * The server is represented by a bunch of logging messages in a window, usually in a terminal/console.  To shut it down, hit Ctrl-C twice.\n",
    " * Every notebook corresponds to both a document and a 'kernel' which runs the code on the server.  If you close a document by closing the browser window, the kernel will still be running and can be shut down (or re-accessed) at the notebook browser.  Kernels store program state of any code executed in cells.\n",
    " * The default location for files is the `notebooks` directory in the folder where you start the lambda notebook from.\n",
    " * Because of all this complexity, there is currently no way to double click in your OS on a notebook and open it.  Rather, you will need to copy the notebook into this Documents directory, run the notebook, and open the file using the notebook browser.\n",
    " * Currently, lambda notebook .ipynb files will not work in vanilla Jupyter notebook unmodified; they require the lambda notebook kernel.  However, in regular python contexts if the lambda notebook is in your python path (as long as it is python 3), you can import the lambda notebook by doing either `import lamb` to get at the framework programmatically, or `import lamb; import lamb.lnsetup; lamb.lnsetup.ipython_setup()` to get the IPython/Jupyter convenience environment and magics.  The lambda notebook infrastructure can be loaded anywhere by using the above import commands.  Two things won't generally work: the magics (which require Jupyter/Ipython) and the fancy equation display, which requires the browser in order to render MathJax.\n",
