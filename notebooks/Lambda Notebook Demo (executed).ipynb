    "# Two problems in formal semantics #\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type-driven computation could be a lot easier to visualize and check.  (Q: could it be made too easy?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Grammar fragments as in Montague Grammar: good idea in principle, hard to use in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **fragment** is a *complete* formalization of *sublanguage* consisting of the *key relevant phenomena* for the problem at hand.  (Potential problem-points italicized.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: a system for developing interactive fragments: \"*IPython Lambda Notebook*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creator can work interactively with analysis -- accelerate development, limit time spent on tedious details.\n",
    "* Reader can explore derivations in ways that are not typically possible in typical paper format.\n",
    "* Creator and reader can be certain that derivations work, verified by the system.\n",
    "* Bring closer together formal semantics and computational modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Von Eijck and Unger (2013): implementation of compositional semantics in Haskell.  No interface (beyond standard Haskell terminal); great if you like Haskell.  Introduced the idea of a fragment in digital form.\n",
    " * UPenn Lambda calculator (Champollion, Tauberer, and Romero 2007): teaching oriented.  (Now under development again.)\n",
    " * `nltk.sem`: implementation of the lambda calculus with a typed metalanguage, interface with theorem provers.  No interactive interface.\n",
    " * Jealousy of R studio, Matlab, Mathematica, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The role of formalism & fragments ###\n",
    "\n",
    "What does *formal* mean in semantics?  What properties should a theory have?\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Mathematically precise (lambda calculus, type theory, logic, model theory(?), ...)\n",
    " 2. Complete (covers \"all\" the relevant data).\n",
    " 3. Predictive (like any scientific theory).\n",
    " 4. Consistent, or at least compatible (with itself, analyses of other phenomena, some unifying conception of the grammar).\n",
    " \n",
    "The *method of fragments* (Partee 1979, Partee and Hendriks 1997) provides a structure for meeting these criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Paper with a fragment provides a working system.  (Probably.)\n",
    " * Explicit outer bound for empirical coverage.\n",
    " * Integration with a particular theory of grammar.  (To some extent.)\n",
    " * Explicit answer to many detailed questions not necessarily dealt with in the text.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Claim**: fragments are a method of replicability, similar to a computational modeller providing their model.\n",
    "\n",
    " * To be clear, a fragment is neither necessary nor sufficient for having a good theory / analysis / paper...\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional benefit: useful internal check for researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"...But I feel strongly that it is important to try to [work with fully explicit fragments] periodically, because otherwise it is extremely easy to think that you have a solution to a problem when in fact you don't.\" (Partee 1979, p. 41)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The challenges of fragments\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the above quote:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"It can be very frustrating to try to specify frameworks and fragments explicitly; this project has not been entirely rewarding.  I would not recommend that one always work with the constraint of full explicitness.\" (Ibid.)\n",
    "\n",
    " * Fragments can be tedious and time-consuming to write (not to mention hard).\n",
    " * Fragments as traditionally written are in practice not easy for a reader to use.\n",
    " \n",
    "   - Dense/unapproachable.  With exactness can come a huge chunk of hard-to-digest formalism.  E.g. Partee (1979), about 10% of the paper.\n",
    "   - Monolithic/non-modular.  For the specified sublanguage, everything specified.  Outside the bounds of the sublanguage, nothing specified.  How does the theory fit in with others?\n",
    "   - Exact opposite of the modern method -- researchers typically hold most aspects of the grammar constant (implicitly) while changing a few key points.  (*Portner and Partee intro*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** In practice, the typical payoff for neither the reader nor the writer of a fragment exceeded the effort.\n"
