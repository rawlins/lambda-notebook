    "1. Type-driven computation could be a lot easier to visualize and check.  (Q: could it be made too easy?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Grammar fragments as in Montague Grammar: good idea in principle, hard to use in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **fragment** is a *complete* formalization of *sublanguage* consisting of the *key relevant phenomena* for the problem at hand.  (Potential problem-points italicized.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: a system for developing interactive fragments: \"*IPython Lambda Notebook*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creator can work interactively with analysis -- accelerate development, limit time spent on tedious details.\n",
    "* Reader can explore derivations in ways that are not typically possible in typical paper format.\n",
    "* Creator and reader can be certain that derivations work, verified by the system.\n",
    "* Bring closer together formal semantics and computational modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Von Eijck and Unger (2013): implementation of compositional semantics in Haskell.  No interface (beyond standard Haskell terminal); great if you like Haskell.  Introduced the idea of a fragment in digital form.\n",

    " 1. Mathematically precise (lambda calculus, type theory, logic, model theory(?), ...)\n",
    " 2. Complete (covers \"all\" the relevant data).\n",

    " 4. Consistent, or at least compatible (with itself, analyses of other phenomena, some unifying conception of the grammar).\n",
    " \n",
    "The *method of fragments* (Partee 1979, Partee and Hendriks 1997) provides a structure for meeting these criteria.\n",

    " * Explicit outer bound for empirical coverage.\n",
    " * Integration with a particular theory of grammar.  (To some extent.)\n",
    " * Explicit answer to many detailed questions not necessarily dealt with in the text.\n",

    "   - Monolithic/non-modular.  For the specified sublanguage, everything specified.  Outside the bounds of the sublanguage, nothing specified.  How does the theory fit in with others?\n",
    "   - Exact opposite of the modern method -- researchers typically hold most aspects of the grammar constant (implicitly) while changing a few key points.  (*Portner and Partee intro*)\n",
