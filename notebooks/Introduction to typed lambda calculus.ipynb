    "In formal semantics, compositionality is typically modeled by the interaction of (potentially higher order) functions, and this interaction is guided by syntactic structure.  Functions are typically characterized using a typed lambda calculus.  An untyped lambda calculus uses representations like \"$\\lambda x \\: \\alpha $\" to characterize a function that given some $x$, returns $\\alpha$.  A typed lambda calculus uses a system of types to place constraints on both $x$ and $\\alpha$, effectively describing the domain and range of the function explicitly.  (Often, types are actually defined in terms of sets, but here I will not do that, as the lambda notebook takes them as primitives.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The two core types in (extensional) formal semantics are $e$ (for entities), and $t$, for truth-values.  A functional type is always a pair of types, with the left member specifying the domain, and the right member specifying the range.  An inductive definition of (simple) types therefore often takes this form:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Atomic types:** $e$ and $t$ are types.\n",
    " 2. **Functional types:** If $\\alpha $ and $\\beta $ are types, then so is $\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle $.\n",
    " 3. **Closure:** Nothing else is a type.\n",
    " \n",
    "Rule 2 is recursive.  So, the type $\\langle e, t \\rangle$ characterizes functions whose domain is the set of entities, and whose range is the set of truth-values.  $\\langle \\langle e, t \\rangle, t \\rangle$ is the type of a function whose input is a (higher order) function of type $\\langle e, t \\rangle$, and whose output is type $t$ (this is of course the type of a generalized quantifier). In the Lambda Notebook, types are written in a similar way, and $e$ and $t$ are built in.  The following shows how to construct these three types using the built-in `tp` (for type parser) function, which parses strings into Type objects."

    "### Typed lambda expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various notational systems/conventions for a typed lambda calculus, but one common notation (or notational shortcut) often seen in formal semantics is to write expressions such as:\n",
    " * $\\lambda x_e . Cat(x)$\n",
    " \n",
    "In Heim and Kratzer, for example, this is really an abbreviation for something like the following, which is basically a two-place $\\lambda$ expression allowing for rich constraints on $x$:\n",
    " * $\\lambda x : x \\in D_e . Cat(x)$\n",
    " \n",
    "Currently the lambda notebook uses _only_ the abbreviated form, i.e. allows only type-based constraints, not the two-place $\\lambda$ expression.  Therefore, a lambda expression in the notebook consists of a variable, a type constraint, and a body.  These expressions both describe a function that, given some $x$ of type $e$, returns true just in case $x$ is a cat.  Notice that, implicitly, the thing to the right of the period is a truth-value, and the predicate $Cat$ can be thought of as having a type as well (though this last part isn't typical; it is often thought of as being a first-order predicate logic constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lambda notebook, this function can be described in the meta-language using the form \"`lambda var_type : body`\", where the variable name (lowercase) is separated from the type by an underscore.  Here's an example:\n",
    " * `lambda x_e : Cat(x)`\n",
    " \n",
    "This example is illustrated below in practice.  The second line of the next cell defines a variable `cat` that is a function of type $\\langle e, t \\rangle $.  This variable is exported into the python environment, and is a subclass of `lamb.meta.TypedExpression` (In this case, `lamb.meta.LFun`, the class for lambda expressions.)"
