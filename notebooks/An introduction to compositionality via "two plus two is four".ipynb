    "# Introducing compositionality and the lambda calculus via simple mathematical language\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10/4/2016, Kyle Rawlins, JHU, kgr@jhu.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: this is based on an example I use in teaching Semantics 1 to introduce the lambda calculus and compositionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I sketch a basic account of the meanings of the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Two plus two is four.\n",
    "(2) Two plus two is five.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use these two simple examples as a vehicle for understanding how compositionality is usually implemented for natural language semantics, using functions in the lambda calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compositionality** is the idea that the meaning of a whole is constructed from the meanings of the parts.  What are the parts?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "I will take it for granted that (1-2) have syntactic structure.  In particular I will assume that their structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1') [[Two [plus [two]]] [is [four]]]\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the verb and \"four\" are a constituent, the subject is a constituent, and \"plus\" is grouped together with the right-hand \"two\".  All branching is binary.  These assumptions aren't trivial, so please consult your favorite syntax source to understand or disagree with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the `nltk` package installed (http://www.nltk.org/), running the following cell will provide a graphical version of this structure.  (If you don't have NLTK installed, rerunning it will lead to an error and erase the tree.)"

    "The first question to ask is what the individual words mean.  I have chosen the numeric example because here we have some easy starting points for answers.  The simplest answer is that the word \"two\" means (in some sense) the number 2.  To make sense of this, you do have to keep in mind that \"2\" is _not the same thing as the word you use to pronounce it_.\n",
    "\n",

    "While there is an easy answer for the numerals, the answer for the other two items (\"plus\", \"is\") is not so straightforward.  A first pass idea, however, is that [[plus]] is something to do with \"+\", and [[is]] is something to do with \"=\".  What, exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, observe that we can't simply say that [[is]] is \"=\".  Along the way, we want to know what the denotation of the VP \"is two\" is.  Setting aside some details, this hypothesis would lead us to expect that [[is two]] is something like \"=2\".  But this is not a well-formed expression of arithmetic! Standard arithmetic \"=\" requires two operators.  So we would need to either change \"=\" to work some other way, or change the assumptions about denotations.  Answering the question of what [[is]] is is therefore not independent of questions of meanings of larger syntactic constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, let us consider what the whole sentence should denote?  A first idea is that it should denote something like True.  That is, it is true, and is perhaps a necessary truth, so we want this computation to lead to calculating that.  A slightly more elaborate idea is that we really want something like: [[two plus two is four]] to be true iff \"2+2=4\" is a true expression of arithmetic.  This is what we will do, and in fact the analysis in this notebook ends up translating the English sentence into the mathematical expression \"2+2=4\".  This is the target of analysis, but the intermediate steps are still murky.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is useful to consider an idea of Frege's.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Statements in general, just like equations or inequalities or expressions in Analysis, can be imagined to be split up into two parts; one complete in itself, and the other in need of supplementation, or “unsaturated.” ... Here too I give the name “function” to what this “unsaturated” part stands for.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Frege's conjecture is a direct answer to the question of what intermediate nodes should denote: they should denote functions.  It also gives interesting labels to hang on certain kinds of denotations.  According to this terminology, [[two]] (etc) are clearly _unsaturated_ -- they are internally complete.  This suggests that the other lexical entries should be functions.\n",

Luckily, such functions are easy to describe.  Before going to the actual natural language semantics, the following box presents two versions of this function stated in python.  You are probably more familiar with the `def` version; the lambda notation is a way of stating anonymous functions quickly without necessarily naming them."

In this case, the meta-language is (apparently) a simple fragment of arithmetic.  In this sense, both of the above results are exactly what I suggested we should want.  The denotation of each of these sentence is a truth value, and what truth value it is (0 or 1) will depend on how the meta-language expression is interpreted."

    "This notebook has illustrated four main things:\n",
    " 1. The basic idea of treating natural language meanings as functions and arguments, in order to understand compositionality.\n",
    " 2. The use of curried functions to model incremental composition in non-trivial syntax. This allows answering questions like, what does a VP denote? (Almost all syntax is non-trivial enough to need this!)\n",
    " 3. A version of the standard notation for doing this using a typed lambda calculus (with a simple mathematical underlying meta-language).\n",
    " 4. How this idea can be implemented in the IPython Lambda Notebook framework.\n",
    " \n",
    "The next step is to extend this idea to non-mathematicalese.  This will raise a number of further questions, one of the more pressing being, what is the metalanguage for more typical nominal expressions like \"cat\" or \"Kyle\" or \"Alabama\"?"
