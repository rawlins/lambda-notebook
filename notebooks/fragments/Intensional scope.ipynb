    "This notebook goes through the basics of three approaches to scope in an intensional context. It is not intended as an introduction to the linguistic issues, but rather as a technical supplement to such an overview (which can be partially found in the von Fintel and Heim lecture notes). That is, this notebook presupposes familiarity with notions like \"de re\", \"the third reading\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three approaches are:\n",
    "* Intensionalization triggered by selection for an intensional type, binding all world variables in the scope of the selecting item (von Fintel and Heim lecture notes).\n",
    "* World variables in the syntax (Percus 2000).\n",
    "* Split intensionality (Keshet 2011).\n",

    "    (1) Joanna believes my brother is Canadian. (After one of Percus's examples)\n",

    "None of the systems above generate the so-called fourth reading: specific/opaque. This is because with QR as the scope mechanism, the QR target position provides a lower bound on the world binding, and this kind of reading would require a world binding that is local, but a quantifier position that is not. There has been some debate about whether the fourth reading exists, so perhaps this is a virtue: see Keshet 2011 footnotes 4,15 for an argument along these lines. However, Szabo in a 2010 Amsterdam Colloquium paper (*Specific, yet opaque*) provides fairly convincing cases of the fourth reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to derive this reading, there are various options.\n",
    "* Szabo: add a new QR operation that moves only the determiner.\n",
    "* Do partial reconstruction of the NP from a pure de re reading into a position where the world variable for the NP gets locally bound. (For Percus, under the world binder, for Keshet or a type-shifting approach, under the `INT` operator.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are a bit convoluted. Here's a sketch of what Szabo's new QR operation would do. This operation moves a quantifier with a silent `thing` restrictor, and leaves a trace that gets interpreted via a variant (of sorts) of Fox's Trace Conversion rule. In Szabo's system, there is a specialized composition rule for this, but for the sake of simplicity, I just hard-code this in a specialized pre-indexed trace entry `rt3`.\n",
