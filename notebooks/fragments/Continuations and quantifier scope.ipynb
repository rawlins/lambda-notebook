    "Based on Chris Barker, \"[Continuations and the Nature of Quantification](http://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/902ad5f7/barker.continuations.pdf)\", Natural Language Semantics, 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a version of Barker's account of scope using continuations.  Barker develops a semantic account of quantifier scope that does not rely at all on LF manipulations etc., but rather complicates the types of lexical items and composition rules in a systematic way to make them more general.  This notebook develops the analysis in roughly the sequence found in Barker's paper; first I show how to continuize ordinary meanings, and how to write a quantifier in this framework.  I then turn to scope ambiguities, scope freezing, and finally inverse linking / QDP-within-QDP cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial note: because I do not use rule-to-rule translation, and instead use general composition rules, the predictions of the system in terms of possible composition paths are somewhat closer to those developed in Yusuke Kubota and Wataru Uegaki, \"[Continuation-based semantics for Conventional Implicatures: The case of Japanese benefactives](http://elanguage.net/journals/salt/article/view/19.18)\", Proceedings of SALT 19, 2009.  Basically, a system with general rules tends to overgenerate possible composition paths that converge on the same meaning; as far as I am aware the resultant S-level meanings (filtered to be the appropriate type) are the same as Barker's system.  I will note several places where this is relevant."

    "An ordinary meaning can be continuized by turning it into a function from its continuation to itself applied as an argument to the continuation.  The continuation represents something like the \"next state\" of the computation.  The continuation of X is always a function from X to type t; the output type is because all derivations (by assumption) end in ordinary type t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is perhaps easiest to see when continuizing type t, exemplified by `raining1` (the proposition that it is raining) and `raining2` (its continuized form) below.  The continuation of something of ordinary type `t` is a function that maps that type to the output type, namely `t`.  Crucially, if the identity function for `<t,t>` is combined via function application with a continuized denotation of this type, we always get back its ordinary denotation.  This is always true of the sentence-level meanings, which I assume to be of type `<<t,t>,t>` following Barker.  The identity function can be thought of as an empty context of sorts.\n",

    "If you think about scope as a form of '_projective meaning_', then this means that in a framework like the present with only _at-issue_ meaning as the other choice, scopal elements project maximally.  This fact was exploited by Kubota and Uegaki in using continuations for Potts-style Conventional Implicature (CI) content, which should project maximally.  It is worth noting, however, that as far as I can see scope is _not_ CI content as such, and we would certainly not want scopal ambiguities to interact with projective meanings in the way that combining the two uses of continuations would involve.  (At the least, tensed finite clauses are not generally a scope island for CI content.)  In summary, it is currently unclear (to me) that continuations can be used as a _general_ mechanism for projective meaning displacement in a compositional semantics, because there are different empirical properties for different types of projective meaning; I don't yet see how it could account for both quantifier scope and CI projection at the same time.\n",
