    " * A representation for `Item`s with indices, which take the form of specialized Item classes for the binder (`lang.Binder`) and the traces/variables (`lang.Trace`, etc).\n",
    " * An implemented version of the `Predicate Abstraction` (PA) composition rule.\n",
    " \n",
    "Both of these are provided as part of `lamb.lang`, in the form of the classes `Binder`, `Trace`, and `IndexedPronoun`, as well as several versions of predicate abstraction. `Binder` in particular is a somewhat unusual kind of `Item` in that it has no content: it is a bearer of an index only. It can have a form, as in this example, or it can be just a pure binder, as in the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For PA, the current composition system is using `lamb.lang.tree_pa_sbc_fun`, if you are curious, though several other implementations are provided.  `sbc` here stands for Semantics Boot Camp: this implementation is based on one from Coppock and Champollion's \"Invitation to Formal Semantics\" (previously known as SBC). This is arguably somewhat simpler than the classic Heim and Kratzer implementation, which manipulates assignments directly. Rather, this version binds any free variables in the contentful argument named in a designated way."
