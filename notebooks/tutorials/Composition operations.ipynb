    "You can write a new composition rule in three ways, in order of complexity (from simplest to hardest):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a metalanguage combinator that describes the rule and instantiate it as a composition rule.  This involves variants of the following syntax:\n",
    "        system.add_binary_rule(combinator, \"NAME\")\n",
    "2. Write a python function that describes the rule (as an operation over meta-language elements) and instantiate it as a composition rule.  The above `add_rule` call expects curried functions, and python functions are usually uncurried, but the call is essentially the same:\n",
    "       system.add_binary_rule_uncurried(function, \"names\")\n",
    "3. Write a python function that operates on object language elements (instances of `lang.SingletonComposable`) and produces an object language element (typically an instance of `lang.Composite`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible, you should apply strategy 1, and then 2.  Both of these handle a whole bunch of bookkeeping for you.  Doing 3 correctly in the general case often requires some detailed knowledge of the internals of the lambda notebook, and it is easy to make mistakes with the most obvious implementations.  (Sometimes it is unavoidable, as in the monster example below, or Predicate Abstraction.)"

The idea of existential closure is to existentially bind of some variable that is currently exposed as a lambda term in a formula.  The idea is easiest to see in the form of a combinator.  Existential closure is usually introduced at other types, but I will just use `e` for exemplification:"
