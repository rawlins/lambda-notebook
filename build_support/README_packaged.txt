# IPython Lambda Notebook.  

Requires OS X 10.8 or later.

To install, drag "Lambda Notebook.app" to your Applications folder (or wherever
you'd like to have it).  Double click, and it will start up the notebook server
and load the interface in your default web browser.

You may need to enable the app in gatekeeper, in your System Preferences
(System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Allow apps downloaded from).

The app will create a notebooks folder in "~/Documents/lambda_notebook/", where
"~" stands in for your home directory, and install some default notebooks
there.  Alternatively, if this app is in a directory with a folder "notebooks",
it will open in that folder.

Bug reports to kgr@jhu.edu!  This is a very preliminary release.
