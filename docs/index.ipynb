    "* doing and verifying calculations involving typed lambda calculus\n",

    "To install the [release version](https://pypi.org/project/lambda-notebook/) from PyPI, use the `pip` command line tool: `pip install lambda-notebook`. On managed jupyter-based systems such as google colab, you can install by entering `!pip install lambda-notebook` into a notebook cell. The current unreleased version of the package can also be installed from source via the github repository: [https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook](https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook). On a managed system, the simplest way to do this is to run `!pip install git+https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook`. Please **report bugs** on that repository via [the issue tracker on github](https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook/issues) if you encounter any!\n",
